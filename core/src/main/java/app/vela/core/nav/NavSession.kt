/**
 * The single owner of an in-progress navigation. Held as a singleton so the
 * foreground [service][app.vela.core] (which feeds it location with the screen
 * off) and the UI ViewModel (which observes [state]) share exactly one nav loop
 * — no double voice prompts, no divergent state.
 *
 * Beyond turn-by-turn it runs a **live re-check**: every [RECHECK_INTERVAL_MS]
 * while underway it re-queries directions from the current position and, if the
 * fresh traffic-aware ETA beats the remaining time by a real margin, surfaces a
 * faster route the user can accept. That's the "is there a better way right now"
 * behaviour traffic apps live on.
