/**
 * Shared endpoint list + failover runner for every keyless **Overpass** (OpenStreetMap query API) fetch in
 * Vela: ALPR/Flock cameras ([OverpassAlprCameras]), traffic controls ([OverpassTrafficSignals]) and the
 * offline OSM POI/address index ([OverpassPois]).
 *
 * A single hardcoded endpoint was a real reliability hole. The main instance `overpass-api.de` regularly
 * returns HTTP 504 "dispatcher" errors when it's under load (observed 2026-07-13 - the exact failure behind
 * a "Flock cameras never show" report: the fetch failed and the layer silently stayed empty). [run] tries
 * each endpoint in turn and uses the FIRST that answers 2xx, so one overloaded mirror no longer takes a
 * whole feature down; the caller only sees a failure when EVERY endpoint is unreachable.
